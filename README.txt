This is a repo of my homework from Math 251, Classification.
In this class we used various packages in python to classify the MNIST Fashion data set

#1:
KNN & Nearest Local Centroid 
(NLC is a method developed by my professor, Dr. Chen)

#2:
PCA + KNN
PCA + NLC
PCA + LDA
PCA + 2DLDA

#3:
LDA
QDA
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Bernoulli Naive Bayes

#4:
Newton's Method
Gradient Descent
Logistic Regression
Regularized Multinomial Logistic Regression

#5:
(Q1 was a pen/paper problem on optimization with constraints)
SVM with Linear Kernel
SVM with Polynomial Kernel
SVM with Gaussian Kernel

#6:
Random Forrests
Bagging
Adaptive Boosting

#7:
Q1: Shallow Neural Network:
	*Logistic Loss
	*Stochastic Gradient Descent
	*Various chosen Learning Rates
Q2: Same as Q1 but with Logistic Loss and L1 or L2 regularization
Q3: changed activation function to relu
